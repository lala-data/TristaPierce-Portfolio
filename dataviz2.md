## Chart Comparison 
For the general government debt charts, I chose to only work with a subset of the data -G20 Countries. 

#### Bar Chart, generated with OECD Data Visualization tool.
This chart was quick and easy to produce. The differences in data using a bar chart is easy to read, but it is only showing one year (2018). Also, there are many chart designs I would have chosen to customize. The background color could be white and labels could have been abreviated and larger for easier reading. 

#### Sparklines, generated with Flourish.
This type of visualization allows for individual trend analysis. I kept the color basic, and the labels minimal to avoid clutter. Although sparklines allow for trend/time analysis, it is not easy to compare one catergory (country) to the next because they are on their own charts. 

#### Combined Line graph, generated with Flourish
I chose to combine the data on a line graph. With the countrys on the same graph, on the same scales, over the same time periods it is easy to compare. I noticed Japan's increasing trend and decdied to highlight that in red. Since the actual data of the other countries is important, but not neccessary to follow individually, I grouped them in a grey scale. I kept clarity in mind with the label and titling positions. I wanted the title, axis labels, and the country labels at the end of the data to properly align. Extra gridlines also would have added unneccesary clutter.
