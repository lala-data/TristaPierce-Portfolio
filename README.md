## About Me
I'm a current graduate student at CMU, in the Master of Information Science- Business Intelligence and Data Analytics track (MISM-BIDA).
I am originally from the St. Louis area, residing here in Pittsburgh. However, being a United States Navy veteran, I've been stationed all along the east coast. 
Personally, I am an adrenaline junkie who loves to travel, cook, and read. After graduate school, I would love to fuse my passion for data, interest in public service, and unique military background to help make a positive impact on as many lives as possible.

## What I hope to learn 
The left side of my brain loves to explore the mountains of data this world is producing every day, in hopes of finding patterns.  The right side of my brain loves to display this data in creative and attractive ways.

There is a Hopi Indian proverb that states: 

> **"Those who tell the 
> stories rule the world"**

An effective way to tell a story that people will remember is through data visualizations. I hope to gain the skills neccesary to provide accurate and eye-catching data visualizations, in hopes of portraying a story that will have a lasting impact on the viewer.
