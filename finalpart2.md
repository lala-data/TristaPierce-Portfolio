# Final Project, Part 2

## Purpose:
I moved to Pittsburgh 3 years ago and have fallen in love with the city. Pittsburgh, known as a quintessential rust-belt city, has made a remarkable recovery after the crash of the steel industry and it is thriving with new industries and culture. I do not think this is common knowledge to individuals who have not visited or lived here. My call to action is for individuals to consider Pittsburgh as a relocation opportunity. 

## Target of Story:
My targeted audience is successful individuals and students who would originally flock to the Bay Area, NYC, Austin, Denver, etc. As a reader, I would want to learn more about Pittsburgh so I can consider relocation opportunities. 

I addressed the topics of tech industries, universities, affordability, culture, restaurants, and the outdoors in my design. 
The story I wanted to tell aimed at the following ideas:
  - Pittsburgh’s revitalization after the fall of the steel industry
  - Why and which tech industries starting moving to Pittsburgh?
  - What good university programs are in Pittsburgh?
  - It's super affordable, and the housing market it good. 
  - What is the culture like in Pittsburgh, to include sports and the arts?
  - The restaurant scene is diverse and full of mixed backgrounds
  - The cities location is great for outdoor activities

## Data:
<ins>Industry Data:</ins> I used dates from company entries into Pittsburgh and created a timeline of their arrival. Data was scraped from this [report](https://www.innovationworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IW-EY-report-2008-to-2017.pdf) and put into an [Excel](/TechCompany.xlsx) file.

<ins>University Data:</ins> I used  information scraped from [QS University Subject Rankings](https://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2020) on top-rated programs in Pittsburgh at different universities and constructed an infographic of information.  

<ins>Affordability Data:</ins> I found this dataset on [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/) and transformed it to an [Excel](/Affordablity.csv). I used a bar chart to highlight Pittsburgh’s ranking compared to other high-tech cities such as San Fran, Denver, Austin, NYC. I also found median housing prices on Zillow and used those to created an infographic. 

<ins>Sports Data:</ins> I compiled a list of national championships, from Google's [database](https://www.google.com/search?q=pittsburgh+steelers+super+bowl+wins&rlz=1C1EJFC_enUS874US874&oq=pittsburgh+steelers+superbowl&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l7.25403j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and manipulated turned it into an [Excel](/SportsData.xlsx) file.  I displayed them by the organization, using their logos on a bar graph. 

<ins>Art Data:</ins> I found some interesting statistics from [Pittsburgh Art Council](websitehttps://www.pittsburghartscouncil.org/advocacy/take-action/facts-and-figures) I made a pictograph to compare attendance.

## User Research Protocol and Interviews and Feedback:
**A. Target Audience:** My story is targeting a specific audience, individuals looking to relocate for work or school. I am aiming to teach them about what Pittsburgh has to offer and why they could reconsider it, compared to other big cities. This with the purpose to increase the Pittsburgh economy and keep the city on an upward swing. 
**B. Identifying Interviewees:** I have chose five individuals for feedback on my story. I chose these five because they are all from different backgrounds and have different exposures to Pittsburgh. Also, three of them would be considered my target audience. 

  - Mid 20s CMU graduate student who is contemplating future employment location
  - Mid 30s highly educated experience in data and design with little Pittsburgh experience
  - Mid 20s tech industry worker looking to go back to school or leave the Bay area in hopes of another job
  - Mid 30s Pittsburgh native with a deep-seated love of the city
  - Early 20s recent arts undergraduate contemplating future employment or higher education

**C. Interview Script and Questions:**
I provided the following information to my interviewees in hopes of identifying any information that is unclear, any ideas that could be improved and to gauge whether or not I am telling my story effectively. I conducted this interview by emailing them my wireframe and having them answer questions via phone call or email reply.
I am friends or family to all the interviewees, so I will briefly describe the purpose of the project and discuss the use of a wireframe. I then asked them the following questions after they take 1-2 minutes to review the wireframe: 

  1. It is clear what story I am trying to tell? 
  2. What is unclear or confusing?
  3. What stands out and is very memorable?
  4. What other information would you like to see?
  5. What do you think my “call to action” is?
  6. Would this compel you to consider living in Pittsburgh?

**D. Feedback:**
 I have incorporated my feedback into the wireframe below

## Final Data Story 
**Focusing On the Targeted Audience**
As previously described, my targeted audience includes successful individuals and students who would originally flock to the Bay Area, NYC, Austin, Denver, etc. As a reader, I would want to learn more about Pittsburgh so I can consider relocation opportunities. 
After more research and feedback, I realized I have a lot of individuals in my life that are exactly this target audience. I myself, as a soon to be transitioning graduate student falls into this audience. So I reflected about what is important to myself and others in my life and asked a lot of questions. Would they care about the arts, would they care about the outdoors? Mostly, I got the same feedback as I would have given…. Yes, I do. However, opportunity trumps everything else. Therefore, I really wanted to highlight tech jobs, college universities and affordability right up front. Then, keeping the fun/engaging slides towards the back. I specifically did add a slide featuring some information on the doors due to it being a consistent feedback from my original work.

**Design Decisions Along the Way** 

Shorthand: To be honest, using Shorthand for the first time was a blessing and a curse. I love the features it has, compared to PowerPoint. However, it’s not as customizable as I originally hoped while planning. Having only few section types to pick from and limited knowledge of how to capitalize on them made it frustrating at first. 
It’s major highlight is the scrolling ability and the ability to add high quality engaging and transforming graphics. I realized right away that I needed a source for images. I signed up for a free subscription trial to Shutterstock, which helped a lot!

Data Visualizations: 
1. Technology Timeline: I first tried Infogram but did not love the lack of customizable activity, so I used Canva to implement this timeline. It was the first time I realized Canvas ability to make attractive and accurate visualizations. I made 2 versions: one that was horizontal and one vertical and asked for feedback from individuals. Overall, due the scrolling capabilities on Shorthand, it was attractive to go with the vertical option. 
2. Universities: I made an infographic from Canva. At first I was going to construct a table, however, it was not attractive nor did it display as much information as I wanted it to. I kept the colors consistent and used a paper background as a way a small touch to add on a infographic of education. 
3. Affordability: I made a bar graph highlighting Pittsburgh’s “affordability” rating compared to other large and midsized cities, in Tableau. I also called out home median prices for Pittsburgh vice the national average. I wasn’t going to add that originally, but I thought the idea and topic needed more color and depth than just the bar graph. 
4. Sports: I used a bit of creativity and Infogram to create the bar chart, I wanted to incorporate the logos and years to make a clearly visually stimulating graphic. 
5. Arts: This was one of the most intriguing stats, Pittsburgh is known as a sports city. So I’d not realize the major arts and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust influence on the city. I used Infogram to great a pictograph and call out the important statistics.

I was going to add more about dining and the outdoors, but honestly fell short on time. Also, my GIS data for the restaurants ended up not loading in Tableau correctly nor do I have ArcGIS on my new computer. But I would like to take another stab at it in the future. 

Overall, from this project, I learned there are many tools to use and ways to portray data. Sometimes the simplest and clear way is better than complicated graphs. I had a lot of fun building my story. I am inspired to use another topic I am very passionate about to build another story in the near future to keep practicing my data visualization skills.
